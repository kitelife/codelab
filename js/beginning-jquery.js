/*
 * for HTML5 doctype(<!DOCTYPE html>)
 * <script src="path/to/your/files.js"></script>
 * is enough.
* */

/*
 * Within a typical HTML file, there are typically two places people use to load
 * their external JS files. The first is within the head, and the second is just
 * before the closing </body> tag. In the past, scripts were always loaded into 
 * the head element, but with performance and page loading speeds more critical 
 * than ever, it's often recommended to place your scripts at the bottom of your 
 * page.
 *
 * The browser renders the page from top to bottom, and when it comes across your 
 * scripts, it pauses rendering the page to load in your JS, the page loads slower 
 * because the rendering is blocked by your loading JavaScript files.
 * */

/*
 * one reason why jQuery is so valuable: everything it offers works just as well 
 * in an older version of Internet Explorer as it does in the latest release of 
 * Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
 * */

/*
 * In DOM, there are three main types of nodes that you need to know: element,
 * text, and attribute nodes.
 * */

/*
 * jQuery uses minifier to compress itself. Minifier performs a number of actions 
 * to get the code down to as small as possible, including:
 * Stripping out all white space
 * Removing all comments
 * Renaming long variable names; for example, var myCar might become var a.
 * */

/*
 * All jQuery does is have a function bound to $. It can detect what you pass into 
 * it, and do certain things. So when you pass in $("body");, it knows to select 
 * the body element. But when you pass in $(function() {});, it detects you passed 
 * in a function, and acts accordingly.

 * Two filters that are very useful are the :even and :odd filters. Combing them

 * function you pass in evaluates to true. It will get rid of elements that make 
 * the function evaluate to false.
 * Within this function, you have access to the current element through the this

/*
 * DOM manipulation is often a huge bottleneck in web sites, so you would try to 
 * do it as little as possible.*/

/*
 * jQuery's css() method is very powerful. There are actually three primary ways 
 * that you'll work with it. The first is when determining the value of an element's 
 * property. Simply pass it one parameter --- the property whose value you want to
 * know:
 * */
$("div").css("width");
$("div").css("margin-right");
$("div").css("color");

/* It’s important to note that if you have a set of more than one element and 
 * you call css(), you’ll get the result as if css() was called on just the first 
 * element. Another important note is that you can’t use shorthand. For example, 
 * this won’t work:
 * $("div").css("margin");
 * */
/*
 * You can also use CSS to set values. To set just one value, pass in a property 
 * and a value as seperate parameters.
 * */
/*
 * What's more useful is that the css() method also accepts an object of key-value 
 * pairs that map CSS properties to the values you want to set:
 * */
$("div").css({
    "background": "red",
    "margin-left": "200px",
    "color": "black"
});

//#############################################################################
$("div").addClass("column");
$("div").removeClass("column");

// If you want to check if an element has a particular class, there' hasClass():
$("div").hasClass("column");
/*
 * That will return true or false. If you want to add a class to something, you 
 * can do it regardless of whether the element already has that class or not. 
 * jQuery is smart enough to sort all that out for you. There's no need to do this:
 * */
if(!$("div").hasClass("main")){
    $("div").addClass("main");
}
/*
 * Simply call addClass(). Similary, there's no need to check whether an element 
 * has a class before you remove that class. Both these methods can take multiple 
 * arguments:
 * */
$("div").addClass("one two three");
$("div").removeClass("four five six");

/*
 * In a situation where you'd like to add a class if the element doesn't have it 
 * --- but remove that same class if the element does have it:
 **/
$("div").toggleClass("main");

//#############################################################################
$("div").hide();
$("div").show();
/*
 * What’s great about them is that when you use hide() to hide an element, 
 * jQuery not only hides it but also remembers its display property. Then, 
 * when you call show() on that element, it sets the display property back to 
 * what it was previously. 
*/

// animate() and Animation Convenience Methods

// slideUp
// slideDown
// slideToggle
/*
* These methods animate elements by height. slideUp will animate an element to a 
* height of 0, creating the effect that the element slides up the page, with 
* its height getting smaller and smaller until it disappears. slideDown does 
* the reverse, animating an element's height to a specific value. Finally, 
* slideToggle will either slide an element up or down, based on the state it's in 
* when you call it. If you call slideToggle on an element that has height 0, it 
* will slide it down and reveal it. If you call slideToggle on an element that 
* is visible, it will slide it up.
* */

//#############################################################################
/*
 * To get and set attributes of DOM elements, jQuery provides the attr() method.
 * This works just like the css() method. There are three ways to do things:
 * */
// $("div").attr("id")  to get the value of the ID attribute.
// $("div").attr("id", "main")  to set the value of the ID attribute to "main"
// $("div").attr({
//      "id": "main",
//      "rel": "one"
// });  to set multiple attributes at once.

// prop() vs. attr()

//#############################################################################
// text() vs. html()
/* If you want to update some text within an element, the best way to do it is 
* by using the text() method.
*
* When you pass in HTML to the text() method, it is automatically escaped for you.
* This means that jQuery replaces the symbol "<" with its HTML entity, which is 
* "&lt;". The browser then displays this as the "<" symbol, but it's not HTML, 
* just plain text.
*
* html() works exactly the same as text() but will not escape any HTML within it.
*
* You shouldn't get into the practice of inserting complex HTML via these methods,
* though. jQuery provides a myriad of options for inserting into the DOM.
*/

//##############################################################################
// Removing Elements from the DOM
/*
 * remove() vs. detach()
 *
 * remove() will remove the set of elements from the DOM but also remove anything 
 * else associated with it --- such as events.
 * 
 * remove() returns the entire set of elements that match the selector, not just
 * the set of elements it just removed.
 * 
 * If you want to remove an element from the DOM but not its associations, there's 
 * detach(). 
 * */
/*
 * At times, you might want to remove everything within an element but not the
 * element itself. This is where empty() comes in.
 * */

/*
 * The final method for removing an element is unwrap(), which does roughly the
 * opposite of empty(). empty() takes an element and removes its children,
 * whereas unwrap() takes an element and removes its parent element.
 * */

// Creating New Elements
/*
* Before getting to inserting new content into the DOM, you first need to look
* at how to create a new object. 
* The easiest way is to create a string of HTML.
* However, this can get complicated very quickly if you're inserting structures
* that are more complex.
* */
var newDiv = $("<div></div>", {
    "text": "Hello",
    "class": "newDiv",
    "title": "Hello"
});
/*
 * That's the best way to create complicated elements, which have a lot of
 * attributes to set. 
 * You call jQuery on an empty element, and then pass in an object that maps
 * properties to values.
 * */

// Inserting into the DOM
/*
* 1. DOM Insertion, Around: These methods let you insert elements around existing
* ones.
* 2. DOM Insertion, Inside: These methods let you insert elements within
* existing ones.
* 3. DOM Insertion, Outside: These methods let you insert elements outside
* existing ones that are completely separate.
* */

// DOM Insertion, Around
/*
 * 1. wrap()
 * 2. wrapAll()
 * 3. wrapInner()

var newDiv = $("<div />", {
    "class": "Hello",
    "text": "Hey"
});

/*
 * wrapAll() does something similar with wrap(): it will take every element in
 * the set and wrap and wrap them all in the new element.
 * */
/*
 * <div>
 *  <p>Hey</p>
 *  <p>Hello</p>
 * </div>
 * */
$("p").wrapAll("<div />");
/*
 * <div>
 *  <div><p>Hey</p><p>Hello</p></div>
 * </div>
 * */
/*
 * The final wrap function is wrapInner(), which wraps the contents of each
 * element in the new element.
 * */
$("p").wrapInner("<strong />");
/*
 * <div><p><strong>Hey</strong></p> <p><strong>Hello</strong></p></div>
 * */

// DOM Insertion, Outside
/*

//##############################################################################
// An introduction to Events

/*
 * Previously there were a huge number of methods, all focused on event binding.
 * There were individual handlers like click(), hover(), and so on. Then there
 * were more methods for general event binding, such as bind(), live() and
 * delegate(). this got complicated and required a lot of explaining. Those
 * methods all still exist in jQuery now, but it's highly advised that you
 * switch to just using on().
 * */

/*
 * hover() isn't actually an event, but it's shorthand for binding two functions
 * at once---one to the mouseenter event, which is executed when the mouse
 * hovers over the element in question, and one for the mouseleave event, which
 * is when the mouse stops hovering over the element.
 * */
$("div").hover(function() {
    alert("hovered in");
}, function() {
    alert("hovered out");
});

/*
 * If you would rather use the new on() method, you have to use the mouseenter
 * and mouseleave events:
 * */
$("div").on("mouseenter", function() {
    alert("hovered over");
}).on("mouseleave", function() {
    alert("hovered out");
});

/*
 * on() allows you to bind the same function to multiple events. Simply pass
 * them into the on() method as a space-demilited string:
 * */
$("div").on("mouseenter mouseleave", function() {
    alert("hovered on or out");
});

$("div").on("mouseenter mouseleave click dblclick", function() {
    alert("hovered on or out, clicked or double clicked");
});

/*
 * The main mouse events you need to be aware of are:
 * click
 * mouseenter
 * mouseleave
 * dblclick
 * */
/*
 * Another important part of jQuery'e events are the form events.
 * jQuery makes enhancing forms using JavaScript --- such as custom validation
 * --- really straightforward.
 * */
/*
<form action="/some/url" method="post">
    <label>Enter your first name: </label>
    <input type="text" name="first_name" >
    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="submit" >
</form>
*/
$("form").on("submit", function() {
    alert("you just submitted the form!");
});

/*
 * For dealing with events on individual inputs, the two events you will use
 * most often are focus and blur, which are exact opposites of each other.
 * The focus event is fired when an element has focus. The most obvious example 
 * is when the user clicks an input box or starts typing in it. At that moment,
 * the element has focus and the focus event is fired. When the user moves on,
 * clicking another element or just off the element, the blur method fired.
 * Think of focus and blur as being a little like mouseenter and mouseleave in
 * how they work. The most important difference is that focus and blur can be
 * triggered in more ways than just via a mouse. The can also be triggered via
 * the keyboard when the user tabs through a form. Thus, for events to be fired
 * based on an input element being active, never use mouseenter or mouseleave.
 * Always use focus and blur.
 * */

$("input").on("focus", function() {
    alert("you're focused on an input");
}).on("blur", function() {
    alert("this input just lost focus");
});


/*
 * Sometimes you might want to manually trigger an event. Perhaps you've got a
 * link that enables the user to fill out a form, and when it's clicked you'd
 * like to fire the submit event on a form. jQuery has the trigger() method to
 * do this for us:
 * */
$("a").on("click", function() {
    $("form").trigger("submit");
});

/*
 * Just as you have on() for binding to events, you have off() for unbinding
 * from events.
 * */
$("div").off();
/*
 * That will unbind all events from every div. You can also pass in an event as
 * the first parameter to unbind all events of that type.
 * */
// It's also possible to unbind just a specific function.
$(function() {
    var clickEvent = function() {
        alert("clickEvent");
    };
    $("p").on("click", function() {
        alert("click");
    }).on("click", clickEvent);

    $("p").off("click", clickEvent);
});

// The Event Object

/*
 * Whenever you bind an event to a function and that function is then triggered,
 * jQuery passes what’s known as the event object. This object contains a lot of 
 * information about the event. To get access to this, just make your event
 * handler take one parameter as an argument. jQuery then passes the event
 * object into this function, and you can get at it through the argument that
 * you denoted your function should take.
 * */
$(function() {
    $("p").on("click", function(event) {
        console.log(event);
    });
});

$(function() {
    $("div").on("hover", function(event) {
        if(event.type === 'mouseenter') {
            $(this).css("background", "blue");
        }else{
            $(this).css("background", "red");
        }
    });
});

/*
 * You can use the pageX and pageY properties to get the position of the mouse
 * when the event fired, relative to the top-left edge of the document window.
 * */
$(function() {
    $("div").on("click", function(event) {
        alert("Your mouse is at X " + event.pageX + " and at Y " + event.pageY);
    });
});

// Building an Accordion
$(function() {
    var headings = $("h2");
    var paragraphs = $("p");
    paragraphs.not(":first").hide();

    headings.on("click", function() {
        var t = $(this);
        if(t.next().is(":visible")) {
            return;
        }

//// More Events

// Event Delegation

/*
 * Two problems:
 * 1. How can you run a function whenever a paragraph is clicked, but still bind
 * it efficiently when there are a lot of paragraphs?
 * 2. How can you make it so any new paragraph inserted into the DOM also run
 * the code when they are clicked?
 * */
/*
 * 'event delegation' means that instead of binding the event to each paragraph
 * individually, you bind the event to a parent element of all the paragraphs
 * and let it delegate the event to the paragraph.
 * */
/*
 * An explanation of how it works:
 * 1. The click event is bound to a parent element of all you paragraphs (keep it
 * simple and use the body element for this example).
 * 2. When the body element detects an event of the type you bound (click, in this
 * case), it checks to see if the click happened on a paragraph.
 * 3. If it was, it fires the function you bound to it. This is where the
 * delegation happens.
 * */

$(function() {
    $("p").on("click", function() {
        alert("Hello world");
    });
    $("<p />", {
        text: "Paragraph 6"
    }).appendTo("body");
});

// vs.
$(function() {
    $("body").on("click", "p", function() {
        alert("Hello world");
    });
    $("<p />", {
        text: "Paragraph 6"
    }).appendTo("body");
});

/*
 * If you're binding an event to just one element, there's no point in
 * delegating because you don't gain anything. 
 * */


// Event Propagation

/*
 * Event propagation is the same as event bubbling; they are simply two terms
 * meaning the same thing.
 * */
/*
 * When an event is fired on a element in the browser, it's not just fired on
 * that element, but every element that is a parent of it.
 * */
/*
 * While most events (including the ones you'll work with most often) propagate,
 * not all of them do.
 * */
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_events

/*
 * Typically, the only time you need to worry about event propagation is when 
 * you are binding an event to both an element and the element's parent.
 * */
/*
 * Luckily, there is a way to stop event propagation. The event object has a
 * method named 'stopPropagation' that can prevents the event from bubbling up
 * the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the
 * event.
 * */
$(function() {
    $("h5").on("click", function(event) {
        alert("header");
        event.stopPropagation();
    });
    $("div").on("click", function() {
        alert("div");
    });
});

/*
 * Unless the propagation of an event is causing an issue, don't prevent it.
 * */

// Preventing Default Behavior
/*
 * Sometimes when you bind to an event, you need to stop the browser from
 * performing the default action attached to that event.
 * */
$(function() {
    $("a").on("click", function(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        $("div").css("background", "blue");
    });
});

//######
$(function() {
    $("a").on("click", function() {
        $("div").css("background", "blue");
        return false;
    });
});

/*
 * Making a handler return Boolean false has the effect of stopping the default
 * event action from being called and stopping the event from propagating. In
 * essence, it effectively is a shortcut for calling stopPropagation and
 * preventDefault.
 * As I explained, most of time you actually don't want to call stopPropagation,
 * so I strongly advise avoiding return false;, and instead use preventDefault.
 * */

// You Own Events
/*
 * A seldom-used but very useful feature of jQuery’s events is the ability to 
 * trigger and bind to your own custom events.
 */
$(function() {
    $("h5").on("click", function() {
        $("div").trigger("bgchange");
    });
    
    $("div").on("bgchange", function() {
        var t = $(this);
        t.css("background-color", "blue");
    });
});

/*
 * The beauty of custom events is that they give you a neat way to package up
 * your code and keep as much of it separate as possible. It also allows you to 
 * assign meaningful names to the events you create, keeping your code easy to 
 * follow and maintain.
 */


$(function() {
    var accordion = $("#accordion");
    var headings = $("h2");
    var paragraphs = $("p");
    paragraphs.not(":first").hide();
    accordion.on("click", "h2", function() {
        var t = $(this);
        var tPara = t.next();
        if(!tPara.is(":visible")) {
            tPara.trigger("showParagraph");
        }
    });

 * actually makes a large number of very small changes to the opacity over time
 * to emulate an animation. There's no actual fading occuring. It's just very
 * quickly changing the opacity by a small amount to give the illusion of
 * animation.

// Ajax with jQuery

/*
 * Unlike JavaScript, keys in JSON object have to have "double quotes" around
 * them.
 *
 * Values in JSON can be of the following types:
 * String
 * Number
 * Array
 * Boolean true/false
 * null
 *
 * Items in arrays can be any of these types, too.
 * Strings need to be double quoted, but the rest don't
 * */

/*
 * JSON.stringify(): Takes a JavaScript object and produces a JSON string from
 * it.
 * JSON.parse(): Takes a JSON string and parses it to a JavaScript object.
 * */

/*
 * Web site (http://caniuse.com/json) is useful for finding out which browsers
 * natively support JSON
 * */

$.ajax({
    "url": "/myurl",
    "type": "POST",     // Default is GET
    "dataType": "json",
    "success": function(data){
        console.log(data);
        ...
    },
    "error": function(jqxhr, msg, error){
        ...
    }
});


/*
 * When jQuery 1.5 launched, it came with a new way of handling callbacks for
 * Ajax requests that improved the syntax hugely.
 * */
/*
 * The jqXHR object is a wrapper around the browser's native XMLHttpRequest
 * object---the way Ajax requests are done with just JavaScript. Every jQuery
 * Ajax method --- both the convenience one like $.getJSON and the main $.ajax
 * method --- returns an instance of this object. What you can then do is add
 * your callback methods onto this, meaning you don't have to define them within
 * the call to the Ajax method.

/*
 * As of jQuery 1.8, using .error() and .success() are deprecated, meaning they
 * shouldn't be used; instead, the following should be used:
 * .done(), which replaces .success()
 * .fail(), which replaces .error()
 * .always(), which runs regardless of whether the request was successful or not
 * */
/*
 * The real advantage of this is that you can set up multiple callbacks:
 */

var req = $.ajax({
    "url": "/someUrl"

req.done(function() {
    //do something
});
req.done(function() {

req.always(function() {

/*
 * By default, the browser won't allow one domain to make an Ajax call to a URL
 * on another domain to pull in data, because this could be potentially
 * dangerous.
 * 
 * Of course, this is not practical when it comes to using third-party APIs, and
 * hence, many workarounds exist. One of the newer workarounds is Cross-Origin
 * Resources Sharing(CORS), which allows the server to include a header in its
 * response, stating that a cross-origin request is valid.
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTTP_access_control
 * 
 * Another solution, the one commonly used today, is to use JSONP, which stands
 * for JSON Padded.
 * http://johnnywey.wordpress.com/2012/05/20/jsonp-how-does-it-work/
 *
 * What if you could put the URL of the data you want into a script tag and get
 * the server's response as a JavaScript script, thus allowing you to get at the
 * data? This is how JSONP works.
